take the frozen chicken patties and put them on a grill. Heat them up until the meat firm. Take a brioche bun and a slice of pepper jack cheese. Put the pepper jack cheese on top of the bricoche bun, and then put it on the pan. Then, take the other bun and put it in the pan and heat it up. Once the patty and buns are ready, take out the lettuce. You can grab small pieces of lettuce and put it over the bun. Next, put the patty over the first bun. Lastly, out the bun with cheese on it over the patty.
